# Rectangles
The code demonstrates the operation of the web service "Rectangles" (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lrqjcv7nh0&t=37s). 
The user specifies the coordinates of five secondary rectangles and the coordinates of the main rectangle (the sixth rectangle). 
When the user navigates to the All Rectangles page, they can see all the rectangles in their initial state according to the specified coordinates.
By using the buttons below, we can change the position of the main rectangle and find the user-specified coordinates according to predefined conditions (the logic can be modified and added). When we click on the "Finding coordinates" button, we will see that the main rectangle encompasses the secondary rectangles. We can observe this visually and display the coordinates of the rectangle. The coordinate output is not implemented in this service, but it can be easily added. 
When we click on the "Finding coordinates need dots" button, we will see that the main rectangle encompasses the edges of the secondary rectangles, whose vertices were initially located inside the main rectangle.
When the user navigates to the ColorRectangles page, they can see all the colored rectangles in their initial state according to the specified coordinates. If we press the buttons below, we will see the position of the main rectangle, which will be arranged according to the color of the secondary rectangles.


The technology stack used to create this service includes: ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, JavaScript (JS), MS SQL database, HTML, CSS, and CANVAS. 
This service demonstrates how to work with shape coordinates using ASP.NET Core MVC.
